            From your dashboard, you will click on "Add Product".  From there you will upload the design that you would like to have on your merchandise, and select a color.  Then click on preview design.  If you are satisfied, click on Save & Continue.  This will take you to a page where you can name your item, give it a price, and set a description.  It is as easy at that.
